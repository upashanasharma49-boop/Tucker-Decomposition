# Tucker-Decomposition
Tucker decomposition generalizes SVD from matrices to tensors, expressing a tensor as a core tensor with orthogonal factor matrices along each mode. The core captures component interactions, while factors provide bases. This code implements Tucker decomposition for an  𝑙 × 𝑚 × 𝑛 tensor, useful in signal processing, compression, and ML.
